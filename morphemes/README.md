# Rules for Morpheme Annotation

* if you do not know the "true" meaning of a morpheme, assign it a question mark
* every syllable of a word needs to be assigned a morpheme, the only exception are cases where you do not know **any** part of a word, here, just leave the field empty
* no whitespace (space) is allowed as a name for any morpheme, since whitespace is used to separate morphemes
* other characters are allowed to name a morpheme, but it is best to stick with alphanumerical letters
* if you do not know one morpheme in a word but know the other morphemes, use a question mark for the respective morpheme to spead up the process
* whenever you know that two morphemes are identical across sources, assign them the same identifier, even if you do not know their full meaning
* name a single morpheme by its concept as a default

# Examples (for Achang_Longchuan)
The last two examples illustrate how to use question marks and to leave a field empty, thus meaning that this word is not related to anything else.
