This book, of 
* 115 pages, 
anthologizes four papers on Burmese historical phonology. For our purposes the long notes at the back and the appendix are most important. In that part he collects cognates among the Burmish languages. 

There is a
* 8 page comparative vocabulary 

of the following 7 languages
* Written Burmese
* Achang
* Xiandao
* Atsi
* Lashi
* Maru
* Bola

On his data sources he offers the following explanation. 

> The following tables, though not exhaustively, list cognate sets for setting out tonal correspondences among the Burmish languages, referred to in the second and fourth papers. All examples of six languages, two Burmic (Achang and Xiandao) and four Marnie (Zaiwa, Leqi, Langsu and Bola) are cited from ZYC, except for a few Achang and Zaiwa forms which are supplied from (Xu and Xu 1984) and (Dai and Cai 1985). Note that the entries of all the four Burmish languages, Burmese (and Mod. WB, transliterated by the Beijing method), Achang, Zaiwa and Langsu contained in ZYHC are supplied by the same authors as those in ZYC. Many of cognate sets are defective. Some sets include irregular forms, which are printed in bold, as in NOTES. Some of them may be ascribable to their provenance from different allofamic forms of Proto-Burmish. Strictly speaking, they are not real cognates. The others may be regarded as misprints or errors (in bold) in original data. Though I tried to correct them through collation with the corresponding forms recorded in (Xu and Xu 1984 ), (Dai and Cai 1985) and (Dai, et al. 1991), I could correct only a few. The source of the forms referred to for correction is indicated by the abbriviations, (X/X), (D/C) and (D).
