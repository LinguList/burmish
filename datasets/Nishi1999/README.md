## Summary

This book, of 115 pages, 
anthologizes four papers on Burmese historical phonology. For our purposes the long notes at the back and the appendix are most important. In that part he collects cognates among the Burmish languages. 

There is a 8 page comparative vocabulary of 7 languages, indicacting cognate morphemes.

## Notes on Orthography Profile

* many basic changes were made to the data, such as representing aspiration as superscript `[h]` rather than normal `[h]`
* creaky voice is only displayed on main vowel
* template for syllables is "i m n N c t"
* compounds are not given in data, but are indicated by dashes, we retain this for comparison with other sources by replacing dash witn `+`
* some questionable cases which were not regular are represented in our "source/target" form, which is also used to indicate when Nishi1999 is not sure about a certain sound or cognate, indicating this with question marks
* correction of `[c]` and `[ch]` in the source, as none of the languages should have this sound

## Source Information

On his data sources he offers the following explanation (pp. 96-97). 

> The following tables, though not exhaustively, list cognate sets for setting
> out tonal correspondences among the Burmish languages, referred to in the
> second and fourth papers. All examples of six languages, two Burmic (Achang
> and Xiandao) and four Marnie (Zaiwa, Leqi, Langsu and Bola) are cited from
> ZYC, except for a few Achang and Zaiwa forms which are supplied from (Xu and
> Xu 1984) and (Dai and Cai 1985). Note that the entries of all the four
> Burmish languages, Burmese (and Mod. WB, transliterated by the Beijing
> method), Achang, Zaiwa and Langsu contained in ZYHC are supplied by the same
> authors as those in ZYC. Many of cognate sets are defective. Some sets
> include irregular forms, which are printed in bold, as in NOTES. Some of them
> may be ascribable to their provenance from different allofamic forms of
> Proto-Burmish. Strictly speaking, they are not real cognates. The others may
> be regarded as misprints or errors (in bold) in original data. Though I tried
> to correct them through collation with the corresponding forms recorded in
> (Xu and Xu 1984 ), (Dai and Cai 1985) and (Dai, et al. 1991), I could correct
> only a few. The source of the forms referred to for correction is indicated
> by the abbriviations, (X/X), (D/C) and (D).
