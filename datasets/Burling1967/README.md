# Dataset by Burling1967

## Summary

This book, of xxx pages, 
provides a reconstruction (pp xxx-xxx) of what the author calls "Proto-Burmish", "Proto-Loloish", and "Proto-Lolo-Burmese" using data from six languages, three Burmish (Burmese, Atsi, Maru) and three Loloish (Lisu, Lahu, Akha). The Loloish languages are outside of the scope of our project. We have digitized the data, but do not intend to use it.
