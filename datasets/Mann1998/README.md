## Summary

This MA thesis, of 175 pages, 
provides a reconstruction (pp 113-124) of what the author calls "North Burmish" using data from six languages

## Notes on Concept List

* Concepticon: [Mann-1998-406](http://concepticon.clld.org/contributions/Mann-1998-406)
* Concepts are sloppily labelled, with differences in the list of 406 proto-forms and the master-list showing the reflexes

## Notes on Arrangement

The data is arranged in different form. The thesis contains

* phoneme inventories with phonotactic information (information diverges from the information given in the morpheme/word list)
* word list arranged as cognate morphemes preceded by PNB proto-form ("Reconstructed Syllables"), where it is not clear whether original compounds have been retained in the order encountered in the original languages
* proto-form list, with compounds being reconstructed following an unclear principle (majority rules?)

## Notes on Reconstruction

* N.B. Mann1998 reconstructs morphemes rather than words, but does provide discussion of multimorphemic words (unlike Nishi1999)

## Digitization Information

NWH typed off the data and the sound inventories. JML corrected the data and created the orthography profile.

## Notes on Orthography Profile

* The profile is created for all languages in the data in one file. 
* Spelling errors in the digitized version were corrected in this profile, as well as IPA lookalikes, like, e.g., `[ɂ]` which is now represented as `[ʔ]` throughout, or the use of `[ö]` instead of `[ø]` in the original.
* Nasalization is only indicated in syllables not ending in nasals.
* A general syllable template of "i m n N c t" is assumed ("N" denotes the second vowel in clusters). Potential exceptions, like consonant cluster `[ŋk]` are represented as "c".
* Nasal vowels are represented as "n c", unless the syllable in question ends in an extra coda.
* Exceptional cases, like the cluster `[kʔ/k]` in Hpun, which also occurs in the source, are respelled as `[kʔ/k]`, thus indicating that we interpret them as `[k]`, but we retain the initial information in our segmentation.
* Nasality is only indicated on the nucleus.
* Creaky voice is represented following IPA conventions, only on the nucleus, not on all vowels in the syllable.
* pragmatic decisions were made for the dipthong "ui" which is interpreted as "n N" rather than "m n", as there's no information on the real pronunciation.
* In the source, we find `[vʷ]` for Maru and Bola, which we treat as `[v]`, as no other sound is indicated in the source inventory. 
* Mann notes in the text, that the Hpun transcription contains instances like `[c]` and `[ch]` which he transcribes to `[tʃ]` etc. In his word list, this principle is not consequently being followed. As a result, we correct for this in our orthography profile.
