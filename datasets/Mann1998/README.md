This MA thesis, of 
* 175 pages, 
provides a reconstruction of what the author calls "North Burmish" using data from six languages

* Achang
* Atsi
* Lashi
* Maru
* Bola
* Hpun 

A note on data sources:
* Hpun data is from Henderson1986
* Bola data is from Edmondson (1992), i.e. Edmondson, J. A. 1992. Trip notebook and audio tapes on Bela language,
Unpublished source material.
* Achang, Atsi, Lashi, Maru, and Zaiwa data are from Wannemacher (1995), i.e. Wannemacher, M. 1995-1997. Notes on Achang, Atsi, Jinghpaw, Lashi, and Maru,
Unpublished Manuscript. (A few years ago Wannemacher shared this data with me, it was in an outdated format that I didn't know what to do with. I might still be able to lay my hands on it.)

The comparative vocabulary of 
* 13 pages

includes
* 575 vocabulary items

according to the version we have typed off in a Goggledoc, which are arranged into concepts according to an SIL list. 

* N.B. Mann1998 reconstructs morphemes rather than words, but does provide discussion of multimorphemic words (unlike Nishi1999).
