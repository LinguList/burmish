## Notes on Concept List

* Concepticon: [Mann-1998-406](http://concepticon.clld.org/contributions/Mann-1998-406)
* Concepts are sloppily labelled, with differences in the list of 406 proto-forms and the master-list showing the reflexes

## Notes on Arrangement

The data is arranged in different form. The thesis contains

* phoneme inventories with phonotactic information (information diverges from the information given in the morpheme/word list)
* word list arranged as cognate morphemes preceded by PNB proto-form ("Reconstructed Syllables"), where it is not clear whether original compounds have been retained in the order encountered in the original languages
* proto-form list, with compounds being reconstructed following an unclear principle (majority rules?)

## Notes on Reconstruction

* N.B. Mann1998 reconstructs morphemes rather than words, but does provide discussion of multimorphemic words (unlike Nishi1999)
