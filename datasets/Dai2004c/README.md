Some Jingpo residents of Luxi, Yingjiang, Longc Iman, Ruili and Lianghe Counties in Yunnan Province refer to themselves as "Liangsu". The Liangsu population is over 3 500. The Liangsu minmunicate with people of other ethnicities in Jingpo, Zaiwa and Chinese, but among themselves they use the Liangsu language. Liangsu differs substantially from Jingpo even though Liangsu people officially belong to the Jingpo nationality. The language is more similar to Burmese, Zaiua and Achang, etc. , than to Jingpo.},
